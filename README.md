# PancreAI microservice for image and label processing

This Django microservice powers the image segmentation and processing. A Nvidia AgentIQ framework has also been built.

![Our goal for PancreAI](output_pancreas.gif)

## How to run the AgentIQ framework

1. Install the Agent Intelligence Toolkit locally, in another directory
2. Return to this directory and run `aiq run --config_file agentiq.yaml --input "Identify current breakthroughs and the state of research for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Then, refer to Nvidia technology for medical breakthroughs, such as MONAI."`

<Document source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy" page=""/>
A pancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as a Whipple procedure, is a major surgical operation most often performed to remove cancerous tumours from the head of the pancreas. It is also used for the treatment of pancreatic or duodenal trauma, or chronic pancreatitis. Due to the shared blood supply of organs in the proximal gastrointestinal system, surgical removal of the head of the pancreas also necessitates removal of the duodenum, proximal jejunum, gallbladder, and, occasionally, part of the stomach.


== Anatomy involved in the procedure ==

The most common technique of a pancreaticoduodenectomy consists of the en bloc removal of the distal segment (antrum) of the stomach, the first and second portions of the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, the common bile duct, and the gallbladder. Lymph nodes in the area are often removed during the operation as well (lymphadenectomy). However, not all lymph nodes...

Medical open network for AI (MONAI) is an open-source, community-supported framework for Deep learning (DL) in healthcare imaging. MONAI provides a collection of domain-optimized implementations of various DL algorithms and utilities specifically designed for medical imaging tasks. MONAI is used in research and industry, aiding the development of various medical imaging applications, including image segmentation, image classification, image registration, and image generation.
MONAI was first introduced in 2019 by a collaborative effort of engineers from Nvidia, the National Institutes of Health, and the King's College London academic community. The framework was developed to address the specific challenges and requirements of DL applied to medical imaging.
Built on top of PyTorch, a popular DL library, MONAI offers a high-level interface for performing everyday medical imaging tasks, including image ...
